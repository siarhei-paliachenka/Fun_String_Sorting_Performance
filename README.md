## Task
Sort a file with lines of a certain format. 

The requirements are as follows: 
- Line format: number, period, space, then any characters until the end of the line. 
- Sorting order: first we sort the text part of the string, then by number if the text parts match. 
- Encoding is UTF-8. 
- The file size is 100GB - guaranteed to be larger than the RAM size. 
- It should work in 1 hour on the inspector’s machine; it’s unlikely that there will be a super-fast SSD and a huge amount of RAM.
